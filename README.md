# 📌 First-Principles Reasoning Engine (FPRE)

The **First-Principles Reasoning Engine** is an AI-powered pedagogical tool designed to help users master complex topics by breaking them down into their most fundamental truths. Inspired by the reasoning methods of polymaths and innovators, this engine strips away analogies and conventions to reveal the irreducible building blocks of knowledge.

## 🎯 1. Project Objective

Build an AI-powered system that enables users to:
- **Deconstruct** any concept into its primary components.
- **Identify** hidden assumptions and social conventions that cloud understanding.
- **Verify** which parts of a system are "Fundamental" (Laws of Physics/Math) vs "Design Choices."
- **Master** topics through active reasoning rather than passive consumption.

## 🚀 2. Core Features

### 🧠 Recursive Decomposition
Start with a high-level query and watch as the engine recursively breaks it down. Each node in the tree represents a component that can be further explored until the most basic principles are reached.

### 🕵️ Assumption Mining
The engine doesn't just explain; it critiques. It identifies "Social Truths"—the things we take for granted—allowing you to see where innovation is possible by challenging the status quo.

### 🎓 Socratic Learning Mode
Move beyond reading definitions. Use the **"Challenge Me"** feature to generate deep, thought-provoking questions that test your fundamental understanding of a specific component.

### 📊 Progress Tracking (Mastery)
Visualize your learning journey. Mark nodes as **"Mastered"** as you understand them, allowing you to track your cognitive progress through complex technical hierarchies.

### 🕸️ Relationship Highlighting
Hover over any node to see its direct lineage. The interface visually traces the path from root concepts to fundamental truths, strengthening the cognitive connections between parts of a system.

## 🛠️ 3. How to Use

1. **Enter a Topic:** Type any complex subject (e.g., "Fusion Energy", "The Stock Market", "Neural Networks").
2. **Select Mode:** Choose between *Concept* (Understanding), *Problem* (Solving), *Compare* (Differentiation), or *Why* (Causality).
3. **Analyze & Execute:** Let the AI analyze your intent, then start the decomposition.
4. **Explore the Tree:** Click the `+` buttons to dive deeper into specific sub-components.
5. **Master the Principle:** Use the sidebar to read deep-dives, view analogies, and take Socratic challenges.

## 🧪 4. The Methodology

This engine follows a 3-step First-Principles process:
1. **Identify and define your current assumptions.**
2. **Break down the problem into its fundamental principles.**
3. **Create new solutions from scratch (The Mastery Path).**
